We're kicking of this years special focus -- RE:imagination -- exploring the possible futures of the Libre Graphics Meeting.

## Background

The Libre Graphics Meeting faced significant challenges during and after
the pandemic. In Rennes, France, 2024, the local organization team revitalized
the event, and now we aim to rebuild the international community and
strengthen the structures around the Libre Graphics Meeting.
