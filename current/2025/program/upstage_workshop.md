A hands-on introduction to UpStage as an online platform for live, collaborative artistic performances.
Participants will create an account on UpStage.Live and learn the basic operations, including how to create
and upload their own media, and manipulate digital media in real time for online audiences. We will work on
the public instance at https://upstage.live/. The focus is on the artistic use of the platform, but if someone is
interested in installing their own UpStage instance, we can also talk about this in the workshop.


## To bring with you

Participants should bring their own laptop and headphones. UpStage functions through a standard browser so
no other software is required. If someone already has ideas of digital media that they want to use, they can
bring this also.
Stable internet is required along with tables and chairs for the participants, beamer and projection surface.
