type: BoF
title: "Graphics and Creative Coding on the JVM"
hosts: [Abe, Edwin, Neil, Raphaël, Stef]
---

This BoF session is aimed at developers working on, or interested in
contributing to, open-source graphics libraries and creative coding
tools that run on the JVM / OpenJDK.  It will be a chance for
knowledge sharing and discussion amongst projects.  A chance to look
at plans for the future, shared concerns, different approaches, common
tools and libraries, and the effect of rapid changes elsewhere in the
OpenJDK ecosystem.

Projects represented will include [Processing](https://processing.org),
[OPENRNDR](https://openrndr.org) and [PraxisLIVE](https://www.praxislive.org).
Everyone is welcome!  Contributors to other graphics or creative
coding projects are actively encouraged to come along and join in.

N.B. This session develops from one originally proposed for the
cancelled LGM in 2020.  That was to be more specifically focused on
Processing, and the projects’ isolation from the wider FLOSS creative
coding, graphics and Java ecosystems.  Much there has changed for the
better since then, and this session offers a natural update of that
proposal for 2025.
