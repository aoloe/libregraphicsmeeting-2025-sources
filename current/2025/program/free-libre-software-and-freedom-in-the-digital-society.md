There are many threats to freedom in the digital society.  They
include nonfree software, massive surveillance, and censorship.

Nonfree programs are often designed to restrict users, control
users or manipulate users.  The War on Sharing aims to stop users
from sharing copies of published works.  Computers for voting make
election results untrustworthy.

Other threats come from use of web services, implemented by
companies that can impose any conditions whatsoever.

Finally, most internet activities (aside from those which existed
before 2000) are precarious, dependent on permission from one company.

All of these threats originate more or less in the use of nonfree
software.  That is why free software is the first battle in
the liberation of the digital society.
