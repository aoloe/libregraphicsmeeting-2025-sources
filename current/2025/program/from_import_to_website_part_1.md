The main subject of the workshop is importing raw photos from the storage
medium (SD card) and developing them with the raw developer ART (Another/Alberto's RawTherapee).

We will start with importing the raw captures from an SD card to the PC
with the photo management software Digikam. After that we will continue
the work with the raw developer software ART, which is a fork of the popular
open source raw developer RawTherapee. ART exists since a few years now,
its creator Alberto Griggio optimised (among other things) the user interface
of the software so it is easier to use for new users (both newcomers to
photography and newcomers to open source photography software). The subjects
of the pictures will be mostly nature shots and landscapes with high dynamic
range (dark foreground, bright sky) that were taken before and after
LGM 2024 in Britanny.

In particular, we will discuss the usage of the following tools in ART:
file browser, exposure/highlight reconstruction, tone equalizer, tone curves,
spot removal, capture sharpening, noise reduction, defringe, white balance,
saturation/vibrance, color equalizer, L*a*b* adjustments, color management,
local editing (color/tone correction, local contrast; parametric, color similarity,
area and brush masks), graduated filter, haze removal, crop, resize, rotate,
perspective correction, lens correction, demosaicing, metadata.
