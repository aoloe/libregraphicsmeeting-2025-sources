After recapping on the basics of usability/UX (user experience), and human-centered design (HCD)
and design thinking (DT), the workshop will give more details about when and how to use a
heuristic evaluation to uncover potential usability issues of a software. Additionally, a commonly
used heuristic by Nielsen and Molich is introduced, and their ten heuristics are explained more in
detail. The main part of the workshop will be a practical exercise. Every participant of the workshop
will have the chance to try out a heuristic evaluation on a software of their choice. This will cover
the different steps of finding and rating issues, as well as consolidating the issues in a group (in case
more than one person chose the same software to inspect). The session will close with a joint
reflection on the process and collecting learnings from conducting a heuristic evaluation. Finally, if
relevant, there will be some room to discuss potential next steps for your software.

### Three takeaways of this session will be

* An understanding of how and when to conduct a heuristic evaluation, as well as an overview
of the ten heuristics by Nielsen
* The practical experience of doing a heuristic evaluation
* A shared reflection and learning on conducting a usability inspection method

## Target group

* UX/usability laymen
* developers of software

## To bring with you

* Device to run/use your/an application you want to evaluate
* (domain) knowledge of the application to evaluate (e.g., what is the purpose of the software and its features)
* No knowledge of UX/usability or heuristic evaluation needed
