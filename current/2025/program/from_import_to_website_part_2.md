In this workshop we will discuss how to add metadata (im particular geotags)
to the photos that we developed in the first part of the workshop, and use
the metadata for automatically creating the caption and the description of the
photos while presenting them on a website. The tools that we will use for those
tasks are: Digikam, Wordpress and Media Library Assistant for Wordpress.

We will start with adding tags and GPS data to the developed photos in Digikam.
We will have a closer look at how to add GPS data to pictures with the help
of a GPS track (GPS correlator tool). In this context, one of the most
interesting features of Digikam is reverse geocoding: the software creates
country, region and location names from GPS tags which are easier to understand
than GPS coordinates for most people. Digikam saves those names as embedded
metadata inside the photos. When the pictures are uploaded to a Wordpress
website, the Wordpress plugin Media Library Assistant extracts the embedded
matadata and uses the information for automatically creating the caption
and the description of the photos. Naturally, as far as the description is
concerned, the EXIF data plays an important role. In addition, we will discuss
how to set up a so called Tag Cloud which can be used by the visitors of the
website to search for and display photos with certain tags and geotags.

Finally, I will also show how to add (attachment) tags and (attachment)
categories to multiple pictures with Media Library Assistant for Wordpress.
