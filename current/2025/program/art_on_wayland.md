title: "Art on Wayland – Challenges and Opportunities for Graphic Tablets"
hosts: ['Nicolas']
---

The Linux desktop is transitioning toward Wayland. This brings many advancements in the graphic
stack and paves the way for new functionality like HDR support. This transition has some profound
implications for digital artists and brings some challenges, particularly around graphics tablet
handling. However with these challenges also come opportunities for newer and better things that
were not possible under the old X11 system.

In this talk we are going to look at how (tablet) input works on Wayland. It will give artists a mental
model of how things work, which can be hugely valueable when communicating with developers
about issues and suggestions. Application developers can learn how to make effective use of tablet
input in their applications.

As part of the “We care about your input!” goal the KDE community, producer of creative software
like Krita and Kdenlive, is working on improving the story around tablet input on Wayland where
necessary. We are going to take a look at what has been happening over the last few years and our
vision for the future of digital art on Linux.
