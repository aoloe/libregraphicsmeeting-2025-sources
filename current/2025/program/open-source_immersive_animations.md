title: Open Source Immersive Animations
hosts: ['Brent']

For several years I have been using my university's planetarium to conduct
experiments with my students and develop a method for creating immersive animations
using only free and open source software. I'd like to share what I've learned at
the Libre Graphics Meeting.

In this workshop I will show participants how to use Blender and other free
and open source tools for creating immersive animations for planetariums and
virtual reality. Blender's Cycles render engine includes multiple options for
rendering immersive media, but the setup, rendering, and playback can be
challenging. Topics like lens settings, resolution, stereoscopic rendering,
render optimization, compression, HDR, and VR headsets will be discussed.

There will be emphasis on navigating the cognitive difficulties that emerge
when working on a flat surface (the average computer monitor) while building
media for a non-flat surface (a planetarium or VR headset).

## To bring with you

Participants should have their own laptops with Blender and Handbrake installed.
