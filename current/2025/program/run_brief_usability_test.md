After recapping on the basics of usability/UX (user experience), and human-centered design (HCD)
and design thinking (DT), the workshop will give more details about when and how to use a
usability test to uncover usability issues of a software. Additionally, the session will give a brief
overview of different usability testing methods. Subsequently, the different aspects and components
of a usability test will be introduced, and the audience has the chance to apply it to a chosen
software. The main part of the workshop will be the practical exercise of conducting a brief
usability test of a chosen software in a group of three in different rounds. The session will close
with a joint reflection on the process and collecting learnings from conducting a usability test.
Finally, if relevant, there will be some room to discuss potential next steps for your software.

* An understanding of how and when to conduct a usability test, as well as an overview of the
