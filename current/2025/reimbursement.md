# Reimbursement

LGM offers to reimburse the travel-only part of expenses for the round-trip
to LGM (economy) for contributors to Libre Graphics who need it and who
are not otherwise sponsored. We offer to cover charges for transport to and
from Nuremberg. For people arriving by car, we reimburse 20¢ (€ 0.2) per
kilometer based on Google maps distance.

The money for reimbursement is raised by the organizing team from [corporate
sponsors]({{rootPath}}/sponsors), and donated by community members through
a [crowdfunding campaign]({{rootPath}}/donate). As money is
always tight, we very much appreciate your support for LGM by paying (partially)
for your own trip. If that is not possible, we are happy to do what we can
so that you can join us for the meeting.

## Who can be reimbursed?

 * Anyone actively contributing to Libre Graphics who needs to meet face-to-face
   to work with other contributors. This can mean software developers, community
   developers, documenters, designers, etc.
 * People who give a talk at LGM

## How does this work?

During LGM, a form will be made available through this page. You may use
the form to upload the required documents, along with your boarding pass,
plus bank account details. Although we’ve managed to raise enough money
in the past to process all of the requested reimbursements, **we cannot
promise we will succeed this year**. In such a case, we will reimburse a
percentage of the total cost of all aggregated requests. This is why we
collect all reimbursement requests before beginning the reimbursement process.

We pay for our bank or transactions fees, however we have no control over the
fees charged by your own bank upon receipt.

We are currently examining the specifics of how these transfers are processed.
Ideally, we aim to partner with an entity in the FLOSS space that has the
necessary processes and experience in this area. We will update this document
with the details as soon as we have them.

## Accepted documents and limits

 * The **proof of purchase** must clearly show the date of the transaction,
   the description, the price and the currency, the name in full and the
   address of the traveler. Incomplete documents are not valid. **A credit
   card transaction record is not a receipt.** *We need the invoice.*
 * The smallest amount we can reimburse on a receipt is € 50 or equivalent
   amount in any other currency. This means that we will not reimburse
   small amounts for local transit, for instance.
 * **Deadline : June 30, 2025.**

While we do ask that you file your request as soon as you can before that
deadline, if for any reason you are unable to make it in time, or if you
have any question, please [contact us directly]({{rootPath}}/contact).
Remember, we are always there to help and we leave nobody behind because
of administrative rules!
