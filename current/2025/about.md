# About

The Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) is an annual meeting on free and open source software for graphics.

Held yearly since 2006 the Libre Graphics Meeting aims to attract developers,
artists and professionals who use and improve free and open source software
graphics applications.

LGM promotes discussions amongst software developers, users, and the large
intersection of those two categories. Unlike many events devoted to
Free/Libre Open Source Software, LGM has always had a strong artistic
focus, with designers and artists showcasing their work alongside the
work of software developers.


More on the history and structure of LGM is available at our [organizational website](/lgm).
