## Sponsorship Information

The Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) is the annual event for developers and
users of free software graphics applications. It provides a unique opportunity
to collaborate and advance the cause of high-quality Free/Libre graphics
software. Since 2006, communities including Inkscape, Scribus, GIMP, Blender,
Krita, and many more have come together for this annual conference.

The 18th annual Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) will be held in Nuremberg, Germany on May 28-31, 2025.

## Special focus – RE:imagination

The Libre Graphics Meeting faced significant challenges during and after
the pandemic. In [Rennes](/2024), France, 2024, the local organization team revitalized
the event, and now we aim to rebuild the international community and
strengthen the structures around the Libre Graphics Meeting. Beyond the
customary contributions, we are looking for presentations and discussions
that embrace the theme of **RE:imagination**, exploring the future of the
Libre Graphics Meeting together.

## Allocation of Funds

As part of our commitment to openness and participation in technology,
we aim to provide [travel subsidies]({{rootPath}}/reimbursement) to
[speakers and active contributors](http://localhost:8081/2025/reimbursement/#who-can-be-reimbursed)
attending the event. Participants include developers, designers, artists,
academics, and activists from around the world, all passionate about
Free/Libre graphics software and technology. LGM is the annual gathering
where they can discuss projects, coordinate efforts, and, most importantly,
meet in person.

**We welcome sponsors who want to help us achieve our goals.**
All funds raised will go towards covering conference expenses and
reimbursing travel costs for participants who actively contribute to
libre graphics and those presenting at the meeting.
