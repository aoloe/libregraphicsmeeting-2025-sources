# Call for Participation

We are thrilled to announce the eighteenth annual Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM)
2025, to be held from **Wednesday, May 28 to Saturday, May 31** in
Nuremberg, Germany. This annual gathering is an opportunity for teams,
contributors, and
practitioners involved in Libre Graphics to work together, share
experiences, and hear new and inspiring ideas.

By Libre Graphics, we mean “Free, Libre, and Open Source tools for creative
uses.” LGM is not just about software but extends to standards and file
formats used in creative work. Participants in LGM include developers,
designers, academics, and activists from around the world who are passionate
about Free/Libre tools and their creative applications.

## We Are Looking For
- Reflections and practical sessions on promoting the philosophy and use of Libre Graphics tools
- Technical presentations and workshops for developers
- Showcases of excellent work made using Libre Graphics tools
- New tools and workflows for graphics and code
- Reflections on the activities of existing Free/Libre and Open Source communities

## Available Formats (times include Q&A)
- Entry for State of Libre Graphics (1-2 slides)
- Presentations (20 minutes)
- Birds of a Feather (BoF), Workshops, Hackathons (1-2 hours)

## State of Libre Graphics
Each meeting begins with a joint session that brings together everything
that has happened in our wide landscape over the last year. Instead of
slots for general updates on the various software projects, we invite every
team to submit two slides (maximum) with a short explanatory text showcasing
the progress made over the past year. For first-time presenters and
particularly big or new topics in established projects, we encourage
additional stand-alone submissions.

## Special focus – RE:imagination

The Libre Graphics Meeting faced significant challenges during and after
the pandemic. In Rennes, France, 2024, the local organization team revitalized
the event, and now we aim to rebuild the international community and
strengthen the structures around the Libre Graphics Meeting.

Join us to reconnect with old friends and forge new connections. Beyond
the customary contributions, we are looking for presentations and discussions
that embrace the theme of **RE:imagination**, exploring the future of the Libre
Graphics Meeting together.

##  Practical Details

Call opens: 18 December 2025

We will let you know if your presentation is selected by end of February 2025 at the latest.

*We welcome all workshop  proposals, but would also like to encourage
workshops which build on  topics addressed in talks. Please don’t hesitate
to submit proposals for both!

If you propose a workshop, let us know what you expect participants to bring,
in terms of both prior experience and required items (sketchbook, laptop
with which applications installed, etc.)

For each BOF or meeting on the public schedule, we ask you to provide
a short report, to be made available to the Libre Graphics Community afterwards.

### Submission Guidelines
- Abstracts should be no longer than 300 words.
- Include a brief bio (100 words) and contact information.
