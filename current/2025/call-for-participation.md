# Call for Participation: Libre Graphics Meeting 2025

We are thrilled to announce the Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) 2025, to be
held from **Wednesday, May 28 to Saturday, May 31** in Nuremberg, Germany.
This annual gathering is an opportunity for teams, contributors, and
practitioners involved in Libre Graphics to work together, share
experiences, and hear new and inspiring ideas.

By Libre Graphics, we mean “free, Libre, and Open Source tools for creative
uses.” LGM is not just about software but extends to standards and file
formats used in creative work. Participants in LGM include developers,
designers, academics, and activists from around the world who are passionate
about Free/Libre tools and their creative applications.

## State of Libre Graphics
Each meeting begins with a joint session that brings together everything
that has happened in our wide landscape over the last year. Instead of
slots for general updates on the various software projects, we invite every
team to submit two slides (maximum) with a short explanatory text showcasing
the progress made over the past year. For first-time presenters and
particularly big or new topics in established projects, we encourage
additional stand-alone submissions.

## We Are Looking For:
- Reflections and practical sessions on promoting the philosophy and use of Libre Graphics tools
- Technical presentations and workshops for developers
- Showcases of excellent work made using Libre Graphics tools
- New tools and workflows for graphics and code
- Reflections on the activities of existing Free/Libre and Open Source communities

## Available Formats (times include Q&A):
- Entry for State of Libre Graphics (1-2 slides)
- Presentations (20 minutes)
- Birds of a Feather (BoF), Workshops, Hackathons (1-2 hours)

## Submission Guidelines:
- Abstracts should be no longer than 300 words.
- Include a brief bio (100 words) and contact information.
- Submissions should be sent to [email protected] by **January 31, 2025**.

We look forward to your contributions and to seeing you in Nuremberg!
