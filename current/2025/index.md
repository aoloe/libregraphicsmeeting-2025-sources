## Special focus – RE:imagination

The Libre Graphics Meeting faced significant challenges during and after
the pandemic. In [Rennes](/2024), France, 2024, the local organization team revitalized
the event, and now we aim to rebuild the international community and
strengthen the structures around the Libre Graphics Meeting.

Join us to reconnect with old friends and forge new connections. Beyond
the customary contributions, we are looking for presentations and discussions
that embrace the theme of **RE:imagination**, exploring the future of the Libre
Graphics Meeting together.
