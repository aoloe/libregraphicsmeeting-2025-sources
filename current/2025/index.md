## Special focus – RE:imagination

The Libre Graphics Meeting faced significant challenges during and after
the pandemic. In [Rennes](/2024), France, 2024, the local organization team revitalized
the event, and now we aim to rebuild the international community and
strengthen the structures around the Libre Graphics Meeting.

Join us to reconnect with old friends and forge new connections. Under the
theme of [RE:imagination]({{rootPath}}/program/label-re-imagination/),
we are going to explore the future of the Libre Graphics Meeting together.
