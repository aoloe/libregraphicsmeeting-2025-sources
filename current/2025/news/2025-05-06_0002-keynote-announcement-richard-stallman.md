## Original Text

On Wednesday, May 28th at 19:30, [Dr. Richard Stallman]({{rootPath}}/hosts/Richard) will deliver a keynote on
[Free/Libre Software and Freedom in the Digital Society]({{rootPath}}/program/free-libre-software-and-freedom-in-the-digital-society/)
at Libre Graphics Meeting.

## Admission/Tickets

Admission to the talk is free of charge at the registration desk when it
opens on **Wednesday**, available on a first-come, first-served basis.
There is no online registration for this; conference registrations remain
separate. This ensures that general conference registrations remain
available for those attending the full event.

## Personal Note of the Organizer

I recognize that opinions on Richard Stallman’s presence vary, and I
acknowledge the concerns some have expressed. Since announcing the keynote
on the [Libre Graphics Meeting mailing list](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libre-graphics-meeting/2025-May/002828.html)
and through previous direct consultations, a pattern of remarks voicing
concern over this decision has emerged. I'm trying to answer these briefly:

### Remark: Why did the announcement come so late?

My time is limited. Up until the [ATypI Copenhagen](https://atypi.org/presentation/parametric-typography-with-parametric-fonts/)
conference I had a double load of work: my regular work and organizing the
LGM. I'm now working on catching up up on LGM tasks.

### Remark: Richard Stallman is controversial.

There have been attacks against him; in the meantime, [stallmansupport.org](https://stallmansupport.org/)
has provided a defense. After reviewing the complaints and the defense,
I concluded that the concerns lacked substantive weight.

### Remark: Lack of relevance, especially for the "graphics" in Libre Graphics Meeting.

His work is relevant to me every day in Libre Graphics. I understand that
this may not be universally shared, but I know others who see it similarly.
Even if his contributions aren’t directly tied to the "graphics" in Libre
Graphics Meeting, I hope we can at least use him as a lens on the past to
inspire ideas for the future.

### Concluding

I hope we can have a conference that is welcoming to everyone and that
discussion and participation, rather than shunning and avoidance, will
make our community grow together.
