title: "Revive the 'State of Libre Graphics'"
lead:  Looking for someone or a group to organize and host the 'State of Libre Graphics' presentation at LGM!
---

 It's a classic tradition and would be great to revive this year. Scheduled right
 after the opening on Wednesday, 20 minutes (with the option to extend a bit). Perfect
 for remote prep + local contribution.

 * [Program item]({{rootPath}}/program/state_of_libre_graphics/)
 * We'll set up a GitHub repo like 2019's: [github.com/libregraphicsmeeting/state-of-lg-2019](https://github.com/libregraphicsmeeting/state-of-lg-2019)
 * Call for contributions will be similar to the [2016 format](/2016/state-of-libre-graphics-union-2016/),
but if you're taking this on, feel free to organize differently!

I can't take this on myselfâ€”already stretched thinâ€”but this would be a fantastic effort. Who's in? ðŸ˜Š
