Our Venue will be the Karl-BrÃ¶ger-Zentrum. I posted the location and some
information in [Venues]({{rootPath}}/venues#main-venue-karl-br%C3%B6ger-zentrum).

We are located very close to the main station and the city center, it should
be easy for you to get to the conference. **You can start looking for accomodation now.**

## ðŸš¨ Only 5 Days Left! ðŸš¨

Our Call for Participation deadline is fast approaching, and **we need your
contributions** to make this a success! Nowâ€™s the time to rally and showcase
your amazing projects.

**Have any leads on captivating projects we should reach out to directly?** Let us know!

<div class="call_for_action"><a href="{{rootPath}}/call-for-participation">Call for Participation</a><br />until January 31, 2025</div>
