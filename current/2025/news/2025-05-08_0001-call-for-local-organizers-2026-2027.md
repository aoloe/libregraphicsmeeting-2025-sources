If you are interested in becoming a future organizer of the LGM, don't
hesitate and [Contact]({{rootPath}}/contact) us. Especially, if you can't
**be in Nuremberg this year**, so that we can keep in touch and update you with
the results from the conference. If there are special request, that you need
us to look into, it would be also great to hear from you.

## What you need to know

There is some old documentation of the the former organizational framework,
but there's nobody left who implements it. You should have a look at it
regardless: [LGM set up](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/lgm/public-documentation/),
or start with the [video linked below](#rebooting-the-libre-graphics-meeting-in-nuremberg-2025)
where Lasse took a look for you.

## Changing Locations is Demanding

The mode of the LGM is traditionally to travel to different location each
year. Before the pandemic, the process was to determine the locations two
years in advance. That way the next year could already be supported by
the team in charge for the year after, and the team of the year after could
collect experience before their actual commitment started. But this model
got disrupted and is dysfunctional currently.

Customary, a local organizer team is in charge of the whole conference
organization. This year, we, as a community, need to find out how our
structure will be constituted, so that support for the local organizers
is possible, and that the barrier to entry can be lowered. For this,
under the banner of the [Special focus – RE:imagination](#special-focus--reimagination),
some [sessions are scheduled]({{rootPath}}/program/label-re-imagination/).

## Rebooting the Libre Graphics Meeting in Nuremberg 2025

Lasse gave a presentation at [OpenSuse Conference 2024](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC24)
about his early steps in becoming the organizer of this years, 2025, edition.
This can be a good entry point for the challenges a local organizer faces.

## Special focus – RE:imagination

The Libre Graphics Meeting faced significant challenges during and after
the pandemic. In [Rennes](/2024), France, 2024, the local organization team revitalized
the event, and now we aim to rebuild the international community and
strengthen the structures around the Libre Graphics Meeting.

Join us to reconnect with old friends and forge new connections. Under the
theme of **RE:imagination**, we are going to explore the future of the Libre
Graphics Meeting together.
