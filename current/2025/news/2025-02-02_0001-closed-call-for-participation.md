**Thank you all for your submissions.** We can already announce that all
proposals will be accepted. We will send notice to all individual
submitters within the coming week.

## Transparency

So far, we'll have 19 presentations and 11 BoFs or Workshops. However, we
can presumably fit some more contributions into the schedule; there
might be a chance for latecomers to have their proposals included.

If you missed the initial deadline, we invite you to submit your proposals now.
Please read the [Call for Participation]({{rootPath}}/call-for-participation).
Details about the process are explaine below.

## What's next?

We will be crafting a preliminary program soon; this will also help us determine
the required premises and the booking of these. Once that's in place,
we will publish the initial program and announce any remaining free slots
for further contributions. New submissions will be accepted on a first-come,
first-served basis, so don't hesitate!
