The [announcement]({{rootPath}}/news/2025-05-06_0002-keynote-announcement-richard-stallman)
made many people angry and upset, and anger and division are not what
LGM is about. Public debate was one of the factors that led to this decision. The discussion can be read here:

**[NOTE]** <em>The following sentence mentioning our Code of Conduct in this
announcement could be interpreted as suggesting we believe Richard Stallman's
presence would make the event less safe. **That interpretation is not our
intention; we don't think that way.** We don't all think that Stallman's
talk would have been a problem. Some of us wanted to hear him. The context
of the discussion linked above is important to correctly interpret this
announcement and the reasons that led to it. Some people voiced general
discomfort about the LGM in the debate; we take these concerns seriously.</em>

LGM is committed to being an inclusive and safe venue for members of the
Libre Graphics community, and we stand by the commitments to safety outlined
by our [Code of Conduct]({{rootPath}}/code-of-conduct).

## Personal Note of the Organizer

I'll be welcoming everyone seeking a conversation with me about the topic.
