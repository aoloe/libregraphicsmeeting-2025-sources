lead: "Due to concerns from the LGM community the planned keynote with Dr. Richard Stallman is cancelled."

The [announcement]({{rootPath}}/news/2025-05-06_0002-keynote-announcement-richard-stallman)
made many people angry and upset, and anger and division are not what
LGM is about. Public debate was one of the factors that led to this decision. The discussion can be read here:
[Inital post on Mastodon](https://post.lurk.org/@lgm/114462101041791903).

LGM is committed to being an inclusive and safe venue for members of the
Libre Graphics community, and we stand by the commitments to safety outlined
by our [Code of Conduct]({{rootPath}}/code-of-conduct).

## Personal Note of the Organizer

I'll be welcoming everyone seeking a conversation with me about the topic.
