title: Call for Acts for the Closing Night Party
lead: "<s>Saturday, May 31st: After the conference program, we have a venue but not a line-up. Yet!</s>"
---

*UPDATE* **we don't have a venue anymore!** I was very late to request Desi
from the beginning and we had a miscommunication. Today (May, 21th) they
pulled back. The line-up was coming together, thus, this call can be
regarded a success. If we can put up a closing night party, it will be
published here.

The party will be at [Desi](https://desi-nbg.de/) it's a great venue with
a strong reputation for hosting diverse cultural events and a welcoming atmosphere.
To the **Artists, DJs, Live Acts, Visual Artists, and Bands** from our community,
**can we make this evening memorable?**

Please [Contact]({{rootPath}}/contact) us. Depending on the feedback and
your individual requirements, well try to orchestrate and see what we can
do. **We can use this venue all the night!**
