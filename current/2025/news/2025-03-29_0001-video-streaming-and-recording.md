    Nothing can beat meeting in person, but the second best thing is live streams and recordings.

We are more than excited to be [partnering]({{rootPath}}/partners/#live-streaming-and-video-recording)
with [Chaos-West TV](https://chaoswest.tv/) to broadcast the LGM live online
and to capture the sessions on video for later viewing via [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/).

While you can stay at home and enjoy the spectacle from afar, our speakers
will have to travel to get into the focus of our cameras. To ease their
effort we are organizing a [reimbursement program]({{rootPath}}/reimbursement/).

If you’d like to help make this possible, please consider [donating]({{rootPath}}/donate).
Your support makes all the difference—thank you!
