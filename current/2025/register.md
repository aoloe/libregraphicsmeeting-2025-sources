**Admisssion for the Libre Graphics Meeting is gratis**, however, we kindly
ask you to register yourself. The venue has limited capacity and we need
this information for our planning.

We use pretix.eu as the registration system.

## Register your Swag

To plan the number of items we will produce, we kindly ask you to register
what you plan to buy. While it's hard to estimate the prices at this point,
**T-shirts will be around €10 to €15**, and **bags will be around €5**.
If possible, we'll try to reserve the items for you, but operational
details may prevent us from doing so.

You will be asked about a bag and shirts after registering for the event
in the registration process.

## As a Presenter or Host of Another Session

**You are already registered** if you are a presenter or host of another session.
Registration is optional, but it will help us estimate how many T-shirts
and Bags to print. Pleas use the **"Presenters-Registration"** option to
not take away a seat from another attendee.

## Additional Remarks

If you have additional notes that are directly attached to your registration,
a text field will allow for that before you finish the registration process.
