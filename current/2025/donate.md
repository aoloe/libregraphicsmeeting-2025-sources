We are delighted to announce that we are working on a crowdfunding campaign
for LGM 2025. **The campaign will be launched through our channels as soon as
it's ready.**

We encourage everyone to help spread the word and donate generously.

All funds raised will go towards covering conference expenses and
reimbursing travel costs for participants who actively contribute to
libre graphics and those presenting at the meeting.

Your donations will help us to bring people together in Nuremberg and make
free software better through collaboration between artists and developers.

Thank you for your support!
