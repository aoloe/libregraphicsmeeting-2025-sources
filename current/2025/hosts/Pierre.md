## Biography

Pierre Marchand writes software and is a researcher at UGent (S:PAM)
He was co-developer of the open-source packages Scribus, Fontmatrix,
Waend and Cartostation. A former visual artist and forestry technician,
he is a programmer-architect for collective projects linked to digital
data and its representation. His research focuses on a form of speculative
programming that activates the dynamics of questioning, both in relation
to the tools and to their historical and cultural dimensions, by
exploring the processes involved in the formation of a digital sensibility.
