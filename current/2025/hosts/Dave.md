## Biography

Dave Crossland attended the first Libre Graphics Meeting in 2006, and became
fascinated with the potential of libre licensing to improve design. Since
then, he has worked to liberate typography, mainly as a program manager for
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). He believes the future is
free time and nothing else; free time, free software, free society.
