## Biography

My name is Ajinkya Dahale. A mechanical engineer by training, I am now a software developer based in India, currently working as a project staff at IIT Bombay, Mumbai. I have been a contributor to FreeCAD since 2016.

In FreeCAD, my focus has been mostly in the 2D constrained drawing workbench "Sketcher", as well as the underlying solver "planegcs". In further detail, my interest has been in adding support for general curved geometry.
