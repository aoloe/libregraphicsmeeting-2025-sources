## Biography

Kaalleen loves Open Source software and machine embroidery (among other
things). When she discovered that there was an extension for Inkscape
which could export embroidery files, she was very fascinated. The
extension was very basic at the time (2017) and the desire to improve
it grew quickly. Without coding experience she started her journey into
python and the world of machine embroidery. She couldn't stop ever
since.
