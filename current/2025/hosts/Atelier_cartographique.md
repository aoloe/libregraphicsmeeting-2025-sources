## Biography

We are a Brussels-based cooperative of cartographic practices. Our professions
weave together software writing, design and territorial research to explore
other modes of urban, social and political interaction.

Each representation of the territory is produced from a specific point of
view and is embedded within a particular production and reception context.
We commit to bring to light that no description of the territory is neutral,
and to bring to life the underlying intentions within the projects with
which we are associated.
