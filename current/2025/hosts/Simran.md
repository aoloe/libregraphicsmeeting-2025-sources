## Biography

Simran works as a technical writer in the database space and is a long-term member of the Pictogrammers icon collective and Olive video editor project. Besides a busy family and work life, he likes to design icons as a creative outlet, and helps out with the infrastructure and community management of the Olive project.

With over a decade of involvement in open-source projects, Simran knows both the highs and lows of working on open-source software, in professional as well as hobbyist capacities. His views on open source are rather pragmatic than ideological, but he is opinionated when it comes to usability. He is excited by the intersection of code and creativity and strives to improve the FLOSS space.
