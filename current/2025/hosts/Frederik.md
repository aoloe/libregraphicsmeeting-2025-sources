## Biography

{{ macro.hostLink('Gottfried') }} and Frederik Steinmetz have been contributing
to the Blender community with tutorials, teaching, patches and addons. Together
they are known as BlenderDiplom for their free tutorials on the subject.

Since 2011 their expertise has grown from modelling/texturing and animation
across physics simulations like particles, fluids and smoke all the way over
to python development. They have been speakers at several Blender Conferences
and Libre Graphics Leipzig. And are now ready to talk about their latest
realm: browser-based interactivity.
